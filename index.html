				<p>“Can designers save the world? Why has design not been at the forefront of the green movement with new solutions and roadmaps for change? How can new design practices alone solve the current environmental crises?”</p>
				<p>Valerie Casey discusses designers' dilemmas between inventing and improving, collaborating and creating a unique position, and being at the forefront of radical change but not chasing a sweeping change. A similar understanding of the importance of looking at the problems and resources at hand without getting lost in the fantasies of global healing powers is shared by Chapelle Ellison. He also talks about the idea of radical change, starting small, and sustainable problem-solving. In his book, Tony Fry introduces frameworks and the idea of Futuring that may change design practice to solve the concerns of ethics, sustainability, and humanity's&nbsp;existence.</p>

                <p>Green design and sustainable living are pertinent matters of our times, perpetually challenging designers to expand their practices. This website is a curation of three textual works that question the designer’s role in creating a radical change towards a sustainable future, stimulating mass behavioral changes, design being at the forefront of global crisis management, and design thinking strategies being at the center of these radical&nbsp;initiatives.</p>
